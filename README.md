Just another repository
My name is Johnny, I am currently learning C++ language but interested in expanding my horizons.

Hi, this is Johnny 3 years later. After learning C++ language and object-oriented programming, life hit some bumps and I fell off.
I am happy to be back and now learning HTML-CSS and JavaScript. I will keep updating this through my progression.
